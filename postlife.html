       Alan Turing was elected as a member of the Royal Society of London in March 1951, in honor to his major
       contributions, including his role in shortening World War II by over two years through his code-breaking machine.
       However, in March 1952, he was convicted of "Gross Indecency," a term that referred to homosexuality, which was
       illegal in Britain at the time. As a result, he was sentenced to 12 months of hormone therapy, which ultimately
       banned him from working for the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British post-war code-breaking
       center. Despite these challenges, Turing continued his groundbreaking work on artificial life, publishing
       “The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis” in 1952, where he detailed his research on the development of form and
       pattern in living organisms. Tragically, just as his new findings gained popularity, he was found dead in his
       bed, having been poisoned by cyanide. Authorities initially suspected suicide; however, the lack of a clear
       motive raised doubts, particularly given that the his hormone therapy had ended over a year before he commited
       suicide, and Turing was reported to be in a great state of mind at the time. Some people also thought that the
       hormone treatment may have affected his mental health, while others theorized that he was murdered by the
       government due to the amount of knowledge of sensitive information he had. Another possibility suggested that
       he accidentally inhaled toxic fumes from cyanide in his laboratory. Ultimately, the cause of Turing’s death
       remain unknown, and the true reason may never be known.
